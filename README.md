# iaia-polygons

This repository stores exported artifacts from using [Image Annotation for Intelligence Amplification](http://iaia.oneoffcoder.com) (IAIA). We generated 1,000 images with random polygons (3 to 10 sided, or triangle to decagon) and annotate them using IAIA. We then export the project and use [darkflow](https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow) and [darknet](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) to learn an object detection model using You Only Look Once (YOLO). All the scripts and artifacts required to train the YOLO object detection model are stored here for reference.
